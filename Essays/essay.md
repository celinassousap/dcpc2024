topic: [How can public policies effectively support digital commons in democratising the European digital landscape?]
---
Tech monopolies are gaining power through network effects, economies of scale, and user lock-in, creating challenges for democracy and obstructing progress of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 8, 9, and 11, which focus on sustainable growth, innovation, and resilient communities (Bühler et al., 2023). These monopolies influence the values and norms that dominate digital civic space which can threaten democratic principles. Making matters worse, once entrenched, these monopolies are difficult to dismantle (Khan, 2007).


In contrast, digital commons foster collaboration and create inclusive, equitable digital ecosystems (Fuchs, 2021). Rooted in the free culture movement and free software philosophy (Lessig, 2004; Stallman, 2002), they offer a decentralised alternative to monopolies and can strengthen the digital sovereignty of states and communities (Open Future, 2024). Their open nature can bridge geographical divides, enhance transparency, and support local skill development, which in turn  can accelerate the achievement of SDGs (Delegation of the European Union to the United Nations, 2023).


Despite their potential, digital commons face challenges such as regulatory uncertainty, insufficient funding, and low visibility, which weaken their governance and security. Strong policies are needed to address these issues and empower digital commons to counter monopolies while fostering knowledge-sharing, democratic practices, and economic growth (Digital Assembly, 2022). This paper advocates for government intervention to strengthen digital commons, exploring three key policy areas: regulatory measures, funding and financing, and capacity building, with successful initiatives highlighted in each area.


**i) Regulatory Policies**

Regulatory policies are vital for supporting digital commons by establishing frameworks that encourage collaboration, equitable access to resources, and empower decentralised digital ecosystems. In the European Union (EU), regulatory efforts have been at the forefront of its efforts to create a fairer, more competitive digital environment.
The main ‘fighter’ in this area has been the Digital Markets Act, which seeks to curb the gatekeeping power of tech monopolies by ensuring greater accountability, fair competition, and interoperability— key measures for broadening user choice and fostering a more competitive digital market. Following its implementation in 2022, the European Commission has begun investigating companies like Google, Apple, and Meta for non-compliance with the Digital Markets Act. However, while regulation can set standards in the digital economy, enforcement remains challenging, slow, and lengthy (Zimmer and Göhsl, 2024).


**ii) Funding and Financing Policies**

Digital commons often face difficulties in maintaining their resources, as they are typically more consumed than sustained. To empower them to compete with commercial alternatives, investment in infrastructure development and financing for effective governance are essential (Frion, 2023).


The EU’s Next Generation Internet (NGI) initiative strengthens digital commons by advancing secure, user-centred, open-source projects that offer privacy-focused, interoperable alternatives to dominant commercial platforms. With over 1,000 projects supported and 74% continuing post-funding, NGI promotes a sustainable ecosystem of commons-based alternatives, fostering Europe’s digital sovereignty (European Commission, 2024a). NGI Commons, in particular, is developing a long-term strategy to support and expand commoners' efforts, mapping the European commons landscape, and coordinating with stakeholders to create a coherent funding framework across public and private sectors for broad, impactful digital commons initiatives (NGI Commons, n.d.).


Accessing funding, however, can be challenging for volunteers managing digital commons due to complex and time-consuming application processes vis-à-vis commoners’ low resources. Streamlining these processes is just as important as creating funding opportunities. The NLnet Foundation’s Zero Commons Fund serves as a best practice example, providing essential support to scale open-source digital tools across the tech spectrum, advancing the idea of an internet commons (NLnet Foundation, 2024).


**iii) Capacity Building, Technical, and Legal Assistance Policies**

Capacity building and legal/technical assistance are crucial for the success of digital commons, as they empower communities to effectively manage shared digital resources and address governance challenges. Well-maintained digital commons can also improve security by leveraging Linus’ law, which suggests that open collaboration leads to more secure digital tools (Raymond, 1999). Furthermore, this type of support can come in the form of financial support or can complement this investment by ensuring that it is used more efficiently, thus enhancing the overall impact of the resources available to digital commons.


During the French Presidency of the Council, a set of recommendations were produced that emphasised the importance of these policies. For instance, creating a “digital commons one-stop shop” to connect projects with funding and expertise is directly facilitating capacity building. Additionally, crucial technical and legal support for digital commons was suggested through the European foundation for digital commons and the principle of promotion of a “digital commons first” approach among public sector bodies (Digital Assembly, 2022). 


The European Digital Infrastructure Consortium (EDIC) exemplifies capacity building at the EU level, advancing cross-border collaboration and pooling resources to foster a sustainable, decentralised digital ecosystem that reduces dependence on external tech giants. EDICs strengthen digital commons by supporting open-source standards and encouraging multi-stakeholder collaboration, building a digital environment that prioritises collective governance, and that promotes EU digital sovereignty, transparency, and accessibility.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, these three policy approaches are essential for empowering digital commons to explore its benefits and capacity to democratise the European digital landscape. As shown in this paper, regulations are needed to curb the power of dominant players (Big Tech), while funding and capacity-building initiatives can help emerging digital commons compete and thrive in the digital market. With public support, they can provide sustainable, inclusive, and human-rights-driven alternatives to monopolistic digital services, ensuring a more equitable and resilient digital future.
