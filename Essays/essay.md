topic: [How can public policies support digital commons?]
---
The challenges created by digital monopolies go beyond merely technology or economic dimensions, as they have profound social and democratic ramifications. They can threaten the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), by hindering sustainable growth, innovation, and resilient communities (Bühler et al., 2023). Moreover, these monopolies can influence the values and norms that dominate digital civic space, thus impacting critical democratic spaces. 

In contrast, digital commons can foster collaboration and create inclusive, equitable digital ecosystems (Fuchs, 2021). Their open nature can bridge geographical divides, enhance transparency and accessibility, and support local skills development, which in turn can accelerate the achievement of the SDGs previously mentioned (Delegation of the European Union to the United Nations, 2023).

This paper advocates for government intervention to strengthen digital commons, exploring three key policy areas: regulatory measures, funding and financing, and capacity building.

**i) Regulatory Policies**

Regulatory policies are vital for supporting digital commons by establishing frameworks that encourage collaboration, equitable access to resources, and empower communities to build decentralised digital ecosystems. In the European Union (EU), regulatory efforts have been at the forefront of its efforts to address unfair market practices and create a fairer, more competitive digital environment.

Its main 'fighter' has been the Digital Markets Act, which seeks to curb the gatekeeping power of tech monopolies by ensuring greater accountability, fair competition, and interoperability— key measures for broadening user choice and fostering a more competitive digital market. Following its implementation, the European Commission has begun investigating companies like Google, Apple, and Meta for non-compliance with the Act. However, while regulation can set crucial standards in the digital economy, enforcement remains challenging, slow, and lengthy (Zimmer and Göhsl, 2024).


**ii) Funding and Financing Policies**

Digital commons often face difficulties in maintaining their resources, as they are typically more consumed than sustained. To empower them to compete with commercial alternatives, investment in infrastructure development and financing for effective governance are essential (Frion, 2023).


A great example in this area is the EU’s Next Generation Internet (NGI) initiative which strengthens digital commons by advancing secure, user-centred, open-source projects that offer privacy-focused, interoperable alternatives to dominant commercial platforms. With over 1,000 projects supported and 74% continuing post-funding, NGI promotes a sustainable ecosystem of commons-based alternatives (European Commission, 2024a). NGI Commons, in particular, is developing a long-term strategy to support and expand commoners’ efforts, mapping the European commons landscape, and coordinating with stakeholders to create a coherent funding framework for digital commons (NGI Commons, n.d.).


Accessing funding, however, can be challenging for volunteers managing digital commons due to complex and time-consuming application processes. Streamlining these processes is just as important as creating funding opportunities. In this area, the NLnet Foundation’s Zero Commons Fund serves as a best practice for making funding more accessible for commoners (NLnet Foundation, 2024).


**iii) Capacity Building Policies**

Capacity building is crucial for the success of digital commons, as they empower communities to effectively address critical security and governance challenges. This support can come in the form of financial support or can help ensure that funding is used more efficiently.


The European Digital Infrastructure Consortium (EDIC) exemplifies capacity building at the EU level, advancing cross-border collaboration and pooling resources to foster a sustainable, decentralised digital ecosystem that reduces dependence on external tech players whilst promoting EU digital sovereignty.


**Conclusion**

In conclusion, these three policy approaches are essential for empowering digital commons to overtake digital monopolies and remedy the economic, social and democratic challenges posed by them. As shown in this paper, regulations are needed to curb the power of dominant players, while funding and capacity-building initiatives are critical to help digital commons become sustainable and inclusive alternatives to the Big Tech.
